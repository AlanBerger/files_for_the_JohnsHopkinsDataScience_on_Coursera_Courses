Data Science Specialization on Coursera series of courses

April 22, 2020 placed here 3 files referred to in the 
3rd programming assignment in the R Programming course 
since the Hospital Compare web site (http://hospitalcompare.hhs.gov) where
they are located is (at the moment)  "down" (and the outcome-of-care-measures.csv file
is necessary to be able to do the assignment).

The next section is copied in from the assignment instructions,
and gives information on these 3 files:

hospital-data.csv
outcome-of-care-measures.csv  **** this is the data file required in the 3rd assignment 
Hospital_Revised_Flatfiles.pdf


from the R Programming course 3rd programming assignment instructions 
-----------------------------------------
" The data for this assignment come from the Hospital Compare web site (http://hospitalcompare.hhs.gov)
run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The purpose of the web site is to provide data and
information about the quality of care at over 4,000 Medicare-certified hospitals in the U.S. This dataset es-
sentially covers all major U.S. hospitals. This dataset is used for a variety of purposes, including determining
whether hospitals should be fined for not providing high quality care to patients (see http://goo.gl/jAXFX
for some background on this particular topic).
The Hospital Compare web site contains a lot of data and we will only look at a small subset for this
assignment. The zip file for this assignment contains three files

* outcome-of-care-measures.csv: Contains information about 30-day mortality and readmission rates
for heart attacks, heart failure, and pneumonia for over 4,000 hospitals.

* hospital-data.csv: Contains information about each hospital.

* Hospital_Revised_Flatfiles.pdf: Descriptions of the variables in each file (i.e the code book).

A description of the variables in each of the files is in the included PDF file named Hospital_Revised_Flatfiles.pdf.
This document contains information about many other files that are not included with this programming
assignment. You will want to focus on the variables for Number 19 (\Outcome of Care Measures.csv") and
Number 11 (\Hospital Data.csv"). You may find it useful to print out this document (at least the pages for
Tables 19 and 11) to have next to you while you work on this assignment. In particular, the numbers of
the variables for each table indicate column indices in each table (i.e. \Hospital Name" is column 2 in the
outcome-of-care-measures.csv file). "
